# Cryptocurrency Clustering Analysis
During this analysis a dataset of various crrptocurrency returns were clustered into segments using the KMeans algorithm. This was done using 2 different scaling methods: the first used the basic StandardScaler function while the second used a PCA model with 3 principal components. Each scaled data set was analyzed to determine the best k value for the clustering process. The datasets were then clustered using the aforementioned 'optimal' number of clusters.

# Dependencies
pandas, hvplot, pathlib and the sklearn library were used in this analysis.
